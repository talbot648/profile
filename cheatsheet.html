                            <td rowspan="3" id="tableimg"> <h3>Variables</h3><br>
                                A variable is a piece of data with an assigned value.<br>
                                Variables can be declared using a keyword called "var" before declaring the variable a name. <br>
                                The variable must be assigned to a type which is either a string, integer or boolean<br>
                                To assign a variable to a value, you have to state the variable and then equals <br>
                                "Input the value". This has to match the assigned type that was previously stated. <br>
                                <br> 
                                <h3>Short assignment operator</h3><br>
                                To make our lives easier, we can use the short assignment operator := which is used to declare and initialise a variable in a single line.<br>
                                It is useful when you don't want to fill up your code with "Var .... int/string" <br>
                                <br> 
                                <h3>If statements</h3><br>
                                An if statement is used to check whether a certain condition is true. If so it will run a certain piece of code. <br>
                                However, if it is false, we can use an else statement to run a different piece of code. <br>
                                <br>

                            <td rowspan="3"> <h3>For loops</h3><br>
                                A for loop is used to do something repeatedly without having to write the code over and over again.<br>
                                For example, you have a box full of books and you want to take a book out one at a time until all <br>
                                of the books are taken out. You would use a for loop.<br>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Example of Go code</h3>
                                Example of code in Go that counts to 10<br>
<pre><code>
package main
    <br>
import "fmt"<br>
<br>
func main() {  <br>
    number := 10  <br>
<br>
    for i := 1; i <= number; i++ { <br>
    fmt.Println(i) <br>
} <br>
} <br>
</code></pre>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Functions</h3> <br>
                                A function is an independent section of code that is used for performing a specific task given from the user. You can picture them as a container. <br>
                                Functions take in parameters which are variables that live inside of the function and can also output these parameters to different functions.

                               The "go mod init" command in short creates a go.mod file for you and initialises a new module. This file also downloads the modules <br>
                               you use in your projects. If you don't have this, you cannot add packages to your progams.<br>

                               There are a couple ways to run Go code. <br>
                               Firstly, you can open up a new terminal and select command line. Then you simply type in "go run ."
                               You could also open up command prompt, navigate to your go code file and run it from there using "go run ."

                                    not needing to manually test each section of code.<br>
                                    Another benefit of automating testing is if you have a large piece of code with a wide variety of <br>
                                    potential outcomes it saves so much time. <br>

                                    Another reason why we automate testing is that the test will actually tell you what line went wrong<br>
                                    and what was expected. This speeds up time taken to fix an error. Also if you are working with a team <br>
                                    it helps everyone see that the code they're interacting with works as executed.</td>
